Build a Shopping List app with Thinkful
=========================

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy and update live.

Introduction
==========
- You will write your code in `public/client.js`
- You might refer to `views/index.html` and `public/style.css`
- You can ignore all the other files :)

Challenges
==========

**Step 1: Add an item to the shopping list**
When someone clicks `Add Item`, add the item in `item-input` to the `shopping-list`

**Step 2: Remove an item**

**Step 3: Add and remove "complete" class to item (when someone clicks the checkbox)**

**More jQuery Challenges**
- If you add an item with no text, it adds a blank box. This is a bug! Fix it.
- Use jQuery to animate the adding and removing of items
- Add a counter that tells the user how many items are in your shopping list

Some Extra Help
==========
**Things you might want to Google**
- What is `var` in Javascript? If you don't know, make sure to Google it!
- Your Javascript code is inside `$(document).ready(function() { })`. Why? 
- For `Step 2` you might want to dig more into "traversing" with jQuery
