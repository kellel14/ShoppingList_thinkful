Build a Shopping List app with Thinkful
=========================

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy and update live. To copy these files and get started with your coding, sign-up for Glitch and click `Remix`.

Introduction
==========
- You will mainly be working inside `public/client.js`
- You will also work inside `views/index.html` and `public/style.css`
- You can drag in `assets` such as images to add them to your project
- You can ignore all the other files :)


**Things you might want to Google**
- What is `var` in Javascript? If you don't know, make sure to Google it!
- Your Javascript code is inside `$(document).ready(function() { })`. Why? 
- For `Step 3

Step 1: Adding an item 
=========
**(when someone clicks `Add Item`)**
- In `Step 1` we've added an "event listener" which runs the code between the curly brackets when `Add Item` is clicked
- We've given you the HTML you'll add to the `shopping-list` section when the button is clicked. That HTML is stored in the variable `itemHtml`

Step 2: Making an item inactive 
========
**(when someone clicks the checkbox)**
- In `Step 2` we've added an "event listener" which runs the code between the curly brackets when the checkbox is clicked
- The shopping item will become inactive when the `complete` class is added 

Step 3: Removing an item 
========
**(when someone clicks `X`)**
- In `Step 3` we've added an "event listener" which runs the code between the curly brackets when the "X" is clicked
- When you click the "X", the shopping item should be removed (hint, you'll need to use "traversing")
