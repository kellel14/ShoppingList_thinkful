Project Overview
------------

For this project
- you will mainly be working inside `public/client.js`
- you will also work inside `views/index.html` and `public/style.css`
- you can drag in `assets` such as images to add them to your project
- you can ignore all the other files :)


**Things you might want to Google**
- What is `var` in Javascript? If you don't know, make sure to Google it!
- your Javascript code is inside `$(document).ready(function() { })`. Why? 


**Step 1: Adding an item (when someone clicks `Add Item`)**
- in `Step 1` we've added an "event listener" which runs the code between the curly brackets when `Add Item` is clicked
- we've given you the HTML you'll add to the `shopping-list` section when the button is clicked. That HTML is stored in the variable `itemHtml`
